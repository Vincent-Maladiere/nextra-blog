# apply conf(2022)

Created: May 25, 2022 9:53 AM

Here are some of my notes from the apply(conf) 2022! 
    
For every presentation, I tried to write the most critical pieces of information that I would be able to remember afterwards; think of it as a low-pass filter. I also tried to include as many slides as I could find on the Slack of the event.
